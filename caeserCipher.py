# Python program to encrypt and decrypt a string, based on a pattern.
# This cipher was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars. The idea is rather simple â€“ every letter of the message is replaced by its nearest consequent (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). The only exception is Z, which becomes A.
